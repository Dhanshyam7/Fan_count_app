# Fan-o-Meter üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Creative Coders


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Gokul Anand - RIT Kottayam
- Member 2: Dhanshyam S - RIT Kottayam

### Project Description
An app that counts how many times a fan rotates ‚Äî because nobody ever needed this, but we did it anyway.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes you're sitting under a fan and you suddenly think,
"How many times has this thing spun today?"
No? Neither did we ‚Äî but it was 100% worth building an app for it.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Fan-o-Meter ‚Äî the world's first (and probably last) app that uses your phone or webcam to count how many times your fan rotates.
Why? Because we wanted to track fan productivity.
Also, science.
